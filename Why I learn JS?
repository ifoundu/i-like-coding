Why I want to learn JS ?

Firstly, I like coding.
I met coding in the first year in college.It was only an optional course of visual fox or something. 
The coding example was used for database. 
I like the logics used in coding, and codes made things automatically. But anyway, I just feel I like it.

Secondly, JS can be the most suitable coding language for me to start currently.
Because I have no much time to learn all coding languages before I use them, like school students.I need to work at the same time.
So I chose to learn the most useful one as a start.
I compared all the popular coding languages, JS, swift,ruby on rails, java, SQL,and found out that JS can be used in different computer systems like Win,Linux,Mac,Android,iOS,etc..
That means whatever computer i will use in future, what i learn can be used with the computer. 

And now, after Mr.Xu told us that JS can be used with even when you just learn a little of it, I realise I really made the best decision.It is quite great for a newbie in coding.

I want to say, Hello coding, I come to you again with a great inspiration. 
Hello JS, let's start. 
And thanks for luck, we can meet such a good course teached by Mr.Xu and thanks for all people work for this course and people talk in the Wechat group, as you inspire me as well.

At last, Mr.Xu, take care. Wish you always all the best.

Sincerely,
hbl
