Why I want to lear JS ?
Firstly, I like coding.
I met coding in the first year in college.It was only an optional course of visual fox or something. 
The coding example was used for database. 
I like the logics used in coding, and codes made things automatically. But anyway, I just feel I like it.
Secondly, JS can be best for me currently.
Because I have no much time to learn all coding languages before I use them, like school students.I need to work at the same time.
So I chose to learn the most useful one as a start.
I compared all the popular coding languages, JS, swift,ruby on rails, java, SQL,and found out that JS can be used in different computer systems like Win,Linux,Mac,Android,iOS,etc..
That means whatever computer i will use in future, what i learn can be used with the computure.
